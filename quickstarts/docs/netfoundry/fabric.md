# Overview
This section will show how to do that through [NF Console](https://nfconsole.io), and programatically  using NF Orchestration's APIs

# via Console UI
1. Click on Network Menu
1. Click on "+" button in the top right corner to create a network
1. Give it a name, e.g. "DemoNet01"

1. Wait until the icon network turns green.

1. Done

# via REST API (Python)

!!! note
    For the code clarity, we have broken down the code into multiple Python modules  

    1. [NF REST CRUD (Create,Read, Update and Delete) operations](../../python/nf_requests.py)
    1. [Get MOP Session Token](../../python/nf_token.py)
    1. [Create NF Network](../../python/nf_network.py)
    1. [Wrapper Script to Create NF Resources based on Resource yaml file](../../python/nf_resources.py)

    To obtain a session token, the [MOP Session Token](../../python/nf_token.py) script parses a configuration file
    for clientId, and secretId if they are not passed to it through the positional arguments
    (env, clientId, secretId). It must be located in the home directory under ['~/.env'](../../python/env)

1. Clone this repo (git clone https://github.com/netfoundry/mop.git)
1. Update [Resource yaml](../../python/nf_resources.yml) file with the desired options to feed into the wrapper script as described
in the following code snippet.
1. Run this from the root folder
``` python
python3 quickstarts/docs/python/nf_resources.py --file quickstarts/docs/python/nf_resources.yml
```
Required Configuration Paramters
``` yaml

environment: {NF Console Environment, e.g. Production}
network_action: { e.g. create, get, delete}
network_name: { e.g. DemoNet01 }
```
1. Done

!!! Note
    The logs will be outputted to the log file named logoutput.txt under the home directory '~/'.
