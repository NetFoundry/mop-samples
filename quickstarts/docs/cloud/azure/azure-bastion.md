**What is a Bastion Host?**

`A bastion host is a server whose purpose is to provide access to a private network from an external network, such as the Internet. Because of its exposure to potential attack, it's important to lock this down as tightly as possible.`

**How can NetFoundry Help?**

`Deploying a bastion host setup with NetFoundry is more secure!  Why?  Because the bastion doesn't need to be directly accessible from outside networks. It only needs outbound access & can reside in either public or private networks.`
