# VCPE Specifics

* Username Allowed: nfadmin
* Root Allowed: No
* Password Authentication: Yes
* Default Password: nfadmin

The best practice is to enable ssh key access after first boot and disable password authentication. If the password option is desirable, the default password must be changed after the first login.
