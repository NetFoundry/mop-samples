It must be located in the home directory under '~/.env' . Additionally, we created the Terraform module ( main.tf and variables.tf ) for Azure to aid the deployment of gateway(s) into Azure vNet(s). We created the Terraform Python modules ( nf_tf_main_file.py and nf_tf_modules.py ) that the python wrapper, script based on Resource yaml file, calls them to create the Terraform plan main file in the working directory, and then applies it using the Terraform module. Assumption, the network named DemoNet01 has already been created. If not network action would need to be \"create\" not \"get\". The \"get\" action just means that the network ID will be search based on the name provided and use to add gateways to.

We created the Terraform Python modules ( nf_tf_main_file.py and nf_tf_modules.py ) that the python wrapper, script based on Resource yaml file, calls them to create the Terraform plan main file in the working directory, and then applies it using the Terraform module.

The \"get\" action just means that the network ID will be search based on the name provided and use to add gateways to.
